# 📊 Stock Price Prediction App - Full Project Overview

## 🚀 Introduction
This project predicts **future stock prices** using **Machine Learning (LSTM Model)**.  
It is built as a **full-stack application**, meaning it has:
- **A backend (Flask API)** that processes stock data & makes predictions.
- **A frontend (React or HTML/CSS)** where users can enter a stock ticker & get predictions.

---

## 🔄 **How Does This Work? (Project Flow)**
1️⃣ **User enters a stock ticker** (e.g., AAPL for Apple).  
2️⃣ **Backend fetches real-time stock data** from Yahoo Finance.  
3️⃣ **Machine Learning (LSTM) model analyzes past stock prices** & predicts future values.  
4️⃣ **Flask API returns the predicted stock prices** in JSON format.  
5️⃣ **Frontend displays predictions in a chart** for easy understanding.  

---

## ⚙️ **Technical Breakdown**
### **1. Backend (Flask + Machine Learning)**
- Fetches **real-time stock data** using `yfinance`.
- Preprocesses data and **trains an LSTM model** (Deep Learning).
- Creates an **API endpoint (`/predict`)** that returns future prices.

### **2. Frontend (React or HTML/CSS)**
- Users enter a stock ticker and click "Predict."
- Calls the **Flask API** to get future stock prices.
- Displays predictions as a **graph**.

---

## 📌 **Current Progress**
### ✅ **Backend (Completed)**
✔ **Built the Machine Learning Model (`model.py`)**
   - Used **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** to predict stock prices.
   - Trained on **past 1-year stock prices**.

✔ **Created a Flask API (`app.py`)**
   - Receives **a stock ticker from the user**.
   - Calls the trained **LSTM model** to predict **next 10 stock prices**.
   - Returns results in **JSON format**.

✔ **Tested API Using Postman**
   - Sent a request:  
     ```json
     {
       "ticker": "AAPL"
     }
     ```
   - Received predicted prices:  
     ```json
     {
       "predictions": [
         [242.57], [241.75], [241.17], ..., [244.56]
       ],
       "ticker": "AAPL"
     }
     ```

## 📊 **Results & What They Mean**
🔹 **The predicted prices represent the expected closing prices for the next 10 days.**  
🔹 **How this is useful in real-world trading?**
   - Helps traders & investors **understand stock trends**.
   - Can be used for **automated stock trading bots**.
   - Shows **market patterns** based on past data.

🔹 **Limitations:**
   - Market is **affected by news, economic events, and investor sentiment**.
   - LSTM works well but can be **improved using real-time sentiment analysis**.

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps (Frontend Development)**
Now that our **backend is working**, we will:
1️⃣ **Build a frontend (React.js or HTML/CSS)** where users can enter a stock ticker.  
2️⃣ **Connect the frontend to Flask API** to display predictions.  
3️⃣ **Deploy the project online** (API + UI) for real-world access.

## 📌 **Final Thought**
This project showcases how **AI-powered stock predictions work**. While it’s not a **perfect predictor**, it is a **step toward understanding financial market trends using Machine Learning**.  

🔹 **Next Up: Building the Frontend!** 🚀
